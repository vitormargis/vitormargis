title: A Little Bit of Info!
---

Hi, my name is **Vitor Margis**. I‘m a graduate of Visual Design from Brazil, currently living in *Saint Paul* (São Paulo). Despite my mainly “visual” background, I’ve always been a web enthusiastic, specially regarding the technical parts. For this reasons as my design course  went by, I’ve always enrolled in extracurricular activities more focused in development/programming.

I've been working with internet for about 8 years now, first as a Designer, and for the last 5 years as a **Front-end Developer**. Right now I hold a position as a full-time front-end developer at a small software studio here in São Paulo, where I had the opportunity to work in some quite amazing projects, for some big companies. Some examples are Abril Publisher, one of Brazil biggests, and Edenred’s brazilian division. In both projects I acted as lead front-end developer, working alongside back-end developers with a variety of backgrounds, using a vast set a technologies.


## But enought chat, lets get to some more techy stuff:

Although I'm not really the biggets of fans of "skill charts", I'll give it a go, since it's the fastest way to give a headsup on my knowledge. But I do encourage you to go and look some of my work and/or my github account for broader information.

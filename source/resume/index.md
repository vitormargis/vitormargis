title: A Little Bit of Info!
---

Hi, my name is **Vitor Margis**. I‘m a graduate of Visual Design from Brazil, currently living in São Paulo. Despite my mainly “visual” background, I’ve always been a web enthusiastic, specially regarding the technical parts. For this reasons as my design course  went by, I’ve always enrolled in extracurricular activities more focused in development/programming.
I've been working with internet for about 9 years now, first as a **Designer**, and for the last 6 years as a **Front-end Developer**.

## But enought chat, lets get to some skills:

Although I'm not really the biggest of fans of "skill charts", I'll give it a go, since it's the fastest way to give a heads-up on my knowledge. But I do encourage you to go and look some of my work and/or my github account for broader information.

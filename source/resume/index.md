I was born in Rio de Janeiro, but lived and graduated in Visual Design in Porto Alegre, and currently live in São Paulo. Despite having a degree in Visual Design, I’ve always been a web enthusiastic, specially the technical bits, and as my design course went by, I’ve always enrolled in extracurricular activities more development/programming related. In a nutshell, you could say I'm a designer that can code, or a programmer that can design... or just... front-end developer and UI designer is fine.

Besides freelancing I'me working for **[Vizir](https://vizir.com.br/)** outsourced to **[Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.codes/)**. With some really fun technologies like React and Node. I still play around with Photoshop from time to time, although now days I prefer this other new tool called **[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)**.

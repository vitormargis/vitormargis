title: A Little Bit of Info!

Hi, my name is **Vitor Margis**. I‘m a graduate of Visual Design from Brazil, currently living in São Paulo. Despite being focused in Design my early years of studying , I’ve always been a web enthusiastic, specially regarding the technical bit, and for this reasons as my design course  went by, I’ve always enrolled in extracurricular activities more focused in development/programming and never looked back.

## But time goeas by and...

Currently it's been about 10 years since I've been working with internet, in the first 4 years as a **Designer**, and for the last 6 years as a **Front-end Developer**. Most of my jobs gets done thought a business I've built with a friend called **[Crafts & Codes](https://crafts.codes/)**. I still play around with Photoshop from time to time, although I do prefer this neat new tool called Affinity Designer, just to keep the hang of it. But my true passion has become Javascript, and is where most of my effort has gone.

But enought chat, if you got here, the odds are you want to get in touch, for a job, for hiring or just to talk. So just **[click here](http://vitor.margis.com.br/contact/)** and I'll show you how. Thanks for the visiting!

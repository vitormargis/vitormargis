I was born in Rio, lived and graduated in Visual Design in Porto Alegre, moved to São Paulo for eight years and currently live in Amsterdam.

Despite my mainly “visual” background, as my design course went by, I enrolled in several extracurricular activities more focused on programming. I’ve always had a passion for anything related to the web and was always sure it was where I wanted to put all my energies. And it has paid off, to have worked with it for the last ten years, first as a **Designer**, and for the last five years as a **Front-end Developer**, has been an exciting journey.

As a teenager, I wanted to design websites, so I put the right side of my brain to work and learned design, but as a designer I wanted actually to build websites, and so I put the left side to work and learned how to code. But the process of learning is never-ending, and soon I learnt that you could not build anything on your own. And so I found myself collaborating with all sorts of people, with different skills, personalities, goals, and dreams, and I liked it.

At the moment I hold a position at **[Travix International](https://www.travix.com/)** , a global leading plane ticket sellers, which, with its 5 brands (CheapTickets, BudgetAir, Vayama, FlugLaden and VliegWinkel), is present in 39 countries. There I work an front-end Engineer Manager and am responsible for building the new front-end platform from the ground up with a incredible global team, using some of the coolest technologies out there.

Anyway... if you got all the way down here, the odds are you want to get in touch, for a job, for hiring or just to talk. So just **[drop by](http://vitor.margis.com.br/contact/)** and I'll show you how we can get in touch. Thanks for the visiting!
